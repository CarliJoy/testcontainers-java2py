# Testcontainers Configuration File
#
# This file demonstrates the available configuration options for testcontainers-python.
# Place this file in your project root or home directory as:
# - ./testcontainers.toml (project-specific)
# - ~/.testcontainers/testcontainers.toml (user-wide)

# Hub Image Name Prefix
# ----------------------
# Automatically prefix Docker Hub images with a private registry.
# Useful for avoiding Docker Hub rate limits or enforcing corporate policies.
#
# Example: postgres:13 becomes registry.corp.com/mirror/postgres:13
[hub]
image_name_prefix = "registry.corp.com/mirror"

# Image Mappings
# --------------
# Map specific images to alternatives.
# Useful for using patched versions or approved images.
#
# Format: "source:tag" = "destination:tag"
[image_mappings]
"postgres:13" = "registry.corp.com/custom/postgres:13-patched"
"mysql:8.0" = "registry.corp.com/approved/mysql:8.0"
"redis:alpine" = "registry.corp.com/cache/redis:alpine"

# Ryuk Configuration
# ------------------
# Ryuk is a container that cleans up containers after tests.
# You can disable it if needed (not recommended for CI).
[ryuk]
disabled = false

# Note: You can also configure these via environment variables:
# - TESTCONTAINERS_HUB_IMAGE_NAME_PREFIX
# - TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED
#
# Environment variables take precedence over this file.
